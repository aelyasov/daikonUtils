<h2>Usage</h2>

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
daikonice [option]*
</blockquote>

With options we can specify a list of oracle-report files (.txt) and a list of violation files.
The first is produced by haslog, the second by Daikon. The program will pretty print the
oracles in an HTML file. The oracles are assumed to specify pre- and post-conditons of events.
Each event has a type (e.g.click), as well as the target of the event (e.g. button1). In the HTML, the oracles will be
grouped according to the names of the event-targets, and then to the event-types. If there are a
reported oracle has a violation, according to a given violation report, this will be indicated
in the HTML. Furthermore, it is possible to specify a minimum number of witnesses. Oracles with
too few number of witnesses will be ignored (not reported).

<h2>Options</h2>


<ul class=optionlist> 

   <li>
   <dl><dt>-r oracles  --oracles=oracles </dt>
   
   <dd>oracles is a list or oracles report files (.txt) produced by Haslog. Such a file contains a list of
   inferred oracles/specifications in the form of pre- and post-conditions of events. A fragment of such a 
   file is shown below, showing pre-conditions (ENTER) and post-conditions (EXIT) of the event named
   buttonSearch.
   
<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
===========================================================================
buttonSearch(..):::ENTER  20 samples
    Variables: cartTotal
cartTotal == "$0.00"		(20 samples)
===========================================================================
buttonSearch(..):::EXIT1  20 samples
    Variables: cartTotal orig(cartTotal)
    Unmodified variables: cartTotal
cartTotal == "$0.00"		(20 samples)
cartTotal == orig(.artTotal)		(20 samples)
=========================================================================== 
</pre>
</blockquote>
 
   </dd>
   </li>
   
   
   <li>
   <dl><dt>-v violations  --violations=violations</dt>
   
    <dd>violations is a list of violation files produced by Daikon (.txt). Such a file is produced
    when we check a Daikon's binary invariant file (.inv) against one or more Daikon trace files
    (.dtrace). A fragement of such a file is shown below:
    
<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
At ppt buttonSearch(..):::ENTER, Invariant 'cartTotal == "$0.00"' invalidated by sample cartTotal="$100": at line 700 in file run22.dtrace
At ppt buttonSearch(..):::ENTER, Invariant 'cartTotal == orig(.artTotal)' invalidated by sample cartTotal="$100": at line 700 in file run22.dtrace
</pre>

   </dd>
   </li>
   
   <li>
   <dl><dt>-o html  --output=html</dt>
   
   <dd>To specify the name of the output .html file.</dd>
   </li>
   
   <li>
   <dl><dt>-n number  --witness-number=number</dt>
   
   <dd>To specify the minimum number of witnesses for an oracle to be reported in the resulting .html.</dd>
